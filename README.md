NumPy Assignment
Title: NumPy Assignment
In this assignment, you'll practice using NumPy to solve a problem. You have been given a dataset that represents the height (in centimeters) of 10 students in a class.

Dataset:

 heights = np.array([160, 155, 172, 165, 180, 158, 175, 163, 171, 168])
Your task is to:

Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the students' heights.

Create a new array with the heights normalized, i.e., each height value should be transformed to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Determine the tallest and shortest students in the class using NumPy's argmax and argmin functions.

Calculate the difference between the tallest and shortest students' heights.

Randomly select 5 heights from the dataset without replacement.
